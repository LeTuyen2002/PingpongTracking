# PingPong Tracking Project

## 📜 Overview
This project is a **real-time ping pong ball tracking system** built with **computer vision techniques**. It detects, tracks, and analyzes the motion of a ping pong ball, visualizing its trajectory for further analysis. This project demonstrates:
- **Color-Based Object Detection**
- **Range Detection**
- **Real-Time Tracking**

## 🛠️ Features
- **Color-Based Tracking**: Tracks the ping pong ball using its unique color.
- **Range Detection**: Dynamically detects the object within a specific range.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes video streams in real-time.
- **Trajectory Visualization**: Displays the ball's motion for analysis.
